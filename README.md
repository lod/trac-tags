Debian package for trac-tags-0.10dev

trac-tags lives at http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TagsPlugin

The current Debian package is 0.7+svn12392-1, this is incompatible
with the current Debian track package 1.2+dfsg-1

The code here packages up the latest trac-tags version which is compatible.

Upgrade need has been flagged in the Debian bug tracker at https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=865967
